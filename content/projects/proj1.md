Hi, this is Baorian. I am a Ph.D. student in Linguistics at The University of Texas at Austin. I am currently working at the [neurolinguistics lab](https://fllanoslucas.wixsite.com/neuroling-lab). My broad research interest is in speech perception and its neural correlates. Now I am focusing on how the human brain processes acoustic information in the speech signal.
