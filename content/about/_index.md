Hi, I’m Baorian Nuchged (I prefer Boroon [bɔɾɔːn]). I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Linguistics at The University of Texas at Austin, where I am advised by Dr. Fernando Llanos and currently work in the [Neurolinguistics Lab](https://fllanoslucas.wixsite.com/neuroling-lab)

My research lies at the intersection of phonetics, neurolinguistics, and computational modeling, with a broad interest in how humans perceive speech and how these processes are represented in the brain. At present, I focus on how the auditory system encodes the speech signal and transforms acoustic information into meaningful units. In particular, I am interested in whether spectrally localized changes can predict robust neural tracking.
