Hi, this is Baorian. I am a masterâ€™s student in Beijing Language and Culture University, advised by Prof. [Jinsong Zhang][1]. My research interest lies in how defective speech is processed by human. To explore this topic, I studied the relationship between computational linguistics, second language (L2) speech, and psycholinguistic data. Recently, I adopted a mutual-information-based functional load model to quantify the information loss of L2 Chinese speech. Then I explored the relation between information loss and comprehensibility.
