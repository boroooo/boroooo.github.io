Hi, this is Rian Bao. I am a masterâ€™s student in Beijing Language and Culture University. My research interest lies in how defective speech is processed by human. To explore this topic, I studied the relationship between computational linguistics, second language (L2) speech, and psycholinguistic data. Recently, I adopted a mutual-information-based functional load model to quantify the L2 Chinese comprehensibility.
